## Plugin Gallery Sandbox
When you want to submit a plugin to [pkp plugin gallery](https://github.com/pkp/plugin-gallery) there's no preview of what it will be the result of the plugin in the ojs plugin gallery. There's no way to check the result of xml that we submit. This plugin is created to solve that problem. You can insert your custom `plugins.xml` link and see the result of the plugin in the plugin gallery.

This plugin is a sandbox for testing submitting new plugins. It is not intended for production use.

## How to use
- Install the plugin.
- Go to the Plugin Gallery.
- Enable this plugin.
- Open Plugin Gallery Sandbox settings
